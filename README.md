## Woman Life Freedom Music Player 
If you want to hear the voices coming out of Iran, I have compiled some of the recent songs alongside their translated lyrics in this web-based music player. We Iranians, either living in Iran or diaspora, have been continually listening and crying to these songs, as they perfecly capture our long-lasting struggle. I will be adding more songs to this list.
